## FAQ

#### How to play the game ?

- Press any key on your keyboard, a colour will blink - which you need to remember and press to complete level 1.
- Once you press on the starting colour, the game will randomly blink another color. Now you need to select the previous colour and the new colour which blinked.
- As you progress, you need to keep the previous colour combination in mind and then click on the new colour which blinks.
